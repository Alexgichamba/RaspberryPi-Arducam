## Add support for Pi4 B
- Just a quick post to let you know that youâ€™ll need a new wiringPi for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

```bash
cd /tmp
```
```bash
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
```
```bash
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb

```Bash
make camera
```

# Running your RPiCameras with ArduCam
Default: enables and tests all four cameras at compile time (comment out ENABLE_CAMERA_X in arducam_multi_adapter_v2.1_c.cpp to disable)
```Bash
./camera
```

## Troubleshoot
- Can't find video0 
	- check if the i2c bus is normal
		- add dtparam=i2c_vc=on to /boot/config.txt,then reboot 
		- run i2cdetect -y 0 to check the devive's address.
		- if it does not detect the device's address, please check the ribbon cable connection to ensure it is not reversed.
